# simple-linear-regression
An implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python for predicting salaries based on years of experience.

Overview
This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to perform Simple Linear Regression using the scikit-learn library. 
The dataset used ('Salary_Data.csv') comprises information about years of experience and their respective salaries.
The code fits a linear model to this data to predict salaries based on the number of years of experience.
Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:
Python (version 3.x)
Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn
install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-linear-regression.git
Run the Code:
cd simple-linear-regression
python simple_linear_regression.py
Results:
The code will perform Simple Linear Regression on the 'Salary_Data.csv' dataset, create visualizations for both the training and test sets, 
and show the relationship between years of experience and salaries.
